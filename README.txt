INTRODUCTION
At Shipwire, we want to be sure our merchants have the best experience getting their information into and out of our system. Merchants have a lot of data, including their Product Catalog and Order History. We'd like to see how you envision creating API services to support these applications.
This RESTful API exercise will be used to evaluate your knowledge of the HTTP and also your engineering abilities. There are no limits as to the amount of time you spend on this or the amount of code you write, but try to keep it simple and presentable. If you need frameworks, libraries, databases, or other tools to write the services, please mention them in the documentation for your API.
Once you've finished your services, please send your results to your recruitment contact. Please share your code on an accessible repository and provide a way for us to access and test your API.
